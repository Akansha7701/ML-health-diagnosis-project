        <h3> About Us</h3>
        <p>
           Welcome to the Medical Health Center, an educational platform where healthcare
           awareness meets machine learning.
        </p>

        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <p>We envision a future where access to basic healthcare information is simple, understandable, and
           easily available for learning and awareness purposes.
        </p>

        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <p>This is an individual academic project developed to apply machine learning concepts in the
            healthcare domain and to gain hands-on experience in full-stack web development.
        </p>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>Our mission is to provide a simple and intuitive platform that demonstrates the
            application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the healthcare domain for
            learning and research purposes.
        </p>

        <h3>How We Do It</h3>
        <p>Our platform utilizes a machine learning model
            trained on a structured dataset of symptoms and diseases.
        </p>

        <h3>Your Well-being, Our Priority</h3>
        <p>Your health is our top priority. We understand that navigating the complexities
            of healthcare can be daunting. That's why we've gone the extra mile to provide
            informative predictions along with general health-related information about each disease.
            The platform provides general information such as disease descriptions, precautionary measures,
            diet suggestions, and lifestyle recommendations sourced from publicly available datasets.
        </p>

        <h3>Join Us on this Journey</h3>
        <p>We invite you to explore our platform, engage with our
            educational content, and take control of your health journey.
            Together, we can revolutionize the way individuals access and understand healthcare information.
        </p>
