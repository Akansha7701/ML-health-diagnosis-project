# Machine Learning Web Application

This is a Machine Learning project developed as a web-based application.
The project integrates a trained Machine Learning model with a frontend website.

Users provide input through the web interface, which is processed by the
Machine Learning model in the backend (`main.py`), and the prediction result is displayed on the frontend.
